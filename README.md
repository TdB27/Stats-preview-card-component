## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me to develop my learning in CSS, mainly about the display: grid / flex; and about the responsiveness from one screen size to another: (375px for mobile and 1440px for desktop).

### Continued development

I plan to improve my CSS and start learning JavaScript.

### Useful resources

- https://desenvolvimentoparaweb.com/css/filtros-css3/ - This site helped me understand the filters that CSS is about to do, without needing the help of external scripts. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
